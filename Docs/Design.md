# Design
After reviewing ERC4337, I've noted both positive and negative aspects.

In a nutshell, the main idea behind ERC4337 is complex. 
While understand the concept, I find the way it's implemented overly complicated. There are four key parts to ERC4337: EntryPoints, Accounts (Wallets), Paymasters, and Bundlers.

- EntryPoints: Used by Bundlers to line up transactions.
- Accounts: Smart contracts acting as user wallets.
- Paymasters: Entities enabling gasless transactions; users pay them to execute transactions.
- Bundlers: Group transactions before sending them to the EntryPoint.

Looking at the system, there are some concerns and advantages. A big worry is the reliance on centralized solutions, especially with Paymasters acting as service providers. If the EntryPoint for a chain gets hacked, it could impact all ERC4337 wallets.

Another issue is the newness of ERC4337; even the official documentation isn't complete. Although OpenZeppelin audits the contracts, there might be undiscovered issues affecting the entire system.

Despite these concerns, I see value in core ideas like gasless transactions and batch execution. However, I suggest exploring simpler smart contract-based approaches to achieve these goals, reducing reliance on centralized elements and making the system more robust.
